Check if sections within the topic cover multiple concepts.\n3. **Determine Splits**: If the topic is found to be covering multiple independent ideas, determine the minimal number of appropriate splits.\n4. **Create New Topics**: Extract content corresponding to each identified idea and create a new topic file for each. Call save_document() function. Compute absolute URLs relative to the URL of the current edited file.\n5. **Ensure Coherence**: Write or update the title and content for each new topic to ensure that each topic is coherent and standalone.\n6. **Update the original topic**: The original topic will be updated to remove the content that has been moved to separate topics.. Use save_document function for that. Don't gererate new content in it, just put a <related-links> with links to the extracted topics while keeping a valid DITA structure. \n7. **Update the dita map**: If the current topic is found in the dita map (or toc), add references to the newly extracted topics as children of the current topic.\n\n# Important\n\n- Ensure that each split topic still makes sense as a standalone unit.\n- The DITA topic must contain the XML declaration and the DOCTYPE declaration.\n- The id attribute on the root element must contain a value that starts with a letter.\n- Avoid unnecessary splits; prefer the minimal number of splits required.\n- Maintain consistency in style and terminology across newly created topics.\n- Ensure new topics retain focus on a single, coherent idea or question.\n",
