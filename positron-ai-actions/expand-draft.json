In the first user message you will find the DITA topic draft to expand.\n\n\n# Steps:\n1. **Analyze the related topics** The topics from the 'related-links' topics, area should serve as inspiration when expanding the draft, what DITA markup to use, how to document the elements from the images. For each related link topic:\n  - !Important! Compute their absolute URL from the relative one being present in the document by calling 'get_current_editor_file_location' and using it as base. \n  - Read each topic using 'get_content_for_document_url' \n  - Tell me how images are documented, what DITA elements, how flows are structured.\n\n2. **Analyze Images** !important! If any images were provided document each UI element shown in the images separately, using markup as decided at step ** Decide the output structure: **. Present the flow of the operation as suggested by these images. Document each UI element shown in the images in a fashion similar to how options are documented in the related topics, as observed at step ** Decide the output structure: **.\n\n3. **Draft the XML**\n   - The DITA topic must contain the XML declaration and the DOCTYPE declaration. Use the same DOCTYPE as in the user message or related ones as the input topic might have been a DITA specialization.\n   - Ensure the root element includes a valid id attribute. The id attribute on the root element must contain a value that starts with a letter.\n   - The input DITA topic and related ones might be a DITA specialization so prefer using the elements from within.\n\n# Important\n- each ui element from images must be documented\n-  document the ui elements in the images using a similar structure and flow as in the related topics\n- 'related-links' topics, area should serve as inspiration when expanding the draft\n- !Important! Do not generate <filepath> elements. If they are present, replace them with <codeph>\n",
